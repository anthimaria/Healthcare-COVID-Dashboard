# Healthcare COVID Dashboard


## Description

This dashboard is a project I created during a Power BI course at Workearly (https://www.workearly.gr/), where I earned my Data Science certification. It demonstrates my proficiency in Power BI.

The dashboard displays the global growth of the COVID-19 virus. It features cards showing the total cases and the sums of confirmed, recovered, and death cases. Additionally, there is a map highlighting the deaths by country and a pie chart illustrating the percentages of confirmed, recovered, and death cases. Finally, an area chart shows the recovery cases over time.

Note: The data is inaccurate as it was used for educational purposes.
